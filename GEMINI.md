# Project Overview

This repository contains materials for an AI learning course. The course appears to be structured into lessons, with each lesson covering different topics in AI and Python programming. The materials include Python scripts (.py), Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb), and links to YouTube recordings of the lectures.

# Directory Overview

*   `/lesson1`: Introduces basic Python programming concepts.
*   `/lesson2`: Covers the `numpy` library for numerical operations in Python.
*   `/lession3`: Appears to be another introductory lesson, including examples of markdown in Jupyter notebooks, and an introduction to the `mglearn` library.
*   `/link`: Contains a `README.md` file with links to YouTube videos, likely recordings of the course lectures.

# Key Files

*   `lesson1/lesson1_1.py`: A simple "Hello, Python!" script.
*   `lesson1/snake_game.html`: An HTML file, likely for a web-based game or demonstration.
*   `lesson2/lesson2_1.ipynb` & `lesson2_2.py` to `lesson2_5.py`: These files cover `numpy` basics.
*   `lession3/lession3_1.ipynb`, `lession3_1.py`, `lession3_2.ipynb`: Introductory materials for lesson 3, including the installation of `wget` and `mglearn`.
*   `lession3/ChineseFont.ttf`: A font file, likely used for displaying Chinese characters in visualizations or notebooks.
*   `link/README.md`: Contains links to YouTube recordings of the course.

# Development Conventions

The project consists of individual scripts and notebooks. There are no explicit build or dependency management files (like `requirements.txt`). To run the Python files, you will need a Python interpreter. To view and run the Jupyter Notebooks, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed.

## Running the code

To run a Python script:

```bash
python <file_name>.py
```

To run a Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook <file_name>.ipynb
```

## Dependencies

Based on the file contents, the following Python libraries are used:

*   `numpy`
*   `wget`
*   `mglearn`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy wget mglearn
```
